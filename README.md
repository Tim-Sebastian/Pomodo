# POMODO - A Pomodoro timer with a To-Do List built with react

Check it out here - https://pomodo-lemon.vercel.app


## Overview
Pomodo is a pomodoro tool that I made because my flora plants kept dying. The Ui looks a bit like its meant for star wars or some sort of strip club, but it still gets the job done.

## Features

### ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer
- **Work Sessions**: 25-minute focused work intervals
- **Short Breaks**: 5-minute refreshing pauses
- **Long Breaks**: 15-minute rest periods


### ✅ To-Do List
- **Dynamic Todo List**: Add, track, and complete tasks with beautiful animations
- **Custom Animated Checkboxes**: Visually satisfying task completion
- **Individual Task Timers**: Track time spent on specific tasks
- **Visual Feedback**: Completed tasks gracefully fade and strikethrough

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Purple Gradient Theme**: Read intro for my thoughts.
- **Animated Elements**: Subtle interactions throughout the interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Works beautifully on various screen sizes (I think...)
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects and transitions  because that makes it look like ive added more effort into it

## How to Use

1. **Set Your Timer**: Choose between Work, Short Break, or Long Break modes
2. **Add Tasks**: Create your todo list for the session
3. **Start Working**: Begin the timer and focus on your selected task
4. **Track Progress**: Watch the app track your time and completed tasks
5. **Take Breaks**: Follow the Pomodoro technique's alternating work and break pattern

## Technology

Built with React and pure CSS, Pomodo works without needing any crazy dependincies!
